            <h3>Economics</h3>
            <p>Economics is concerned with the creation, consumption,
             and transfer of wealth. The study of economics encompasses the major areas of microeconomics,
             which explores how people and firms produce and consume goods and services, and macroeconomics,
             which explores mass economic progress and inter-country trade. Part of the social sciences group,
             economics explores the full spectrum of issues that impact on financial situations and decisions. </p>

        <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Medecine</h3>
                <p>Medicine and Health is a broad field of study that equips students with the necessary knowledge and skills
                 to treat and prevent illnesses and diseases in human beings or animals. We introduce students to
                 medical science and the ways a person's lifestyle and age affect health.
                 Students usually study biology and chemistry, and classes might emphasize the philosophy
                 behind medicine as well as ethical concerns.</p>

        <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Law</h3>
                <p>Law degrees have always been among the most sought-after and widely respected courses to study at university.
                 Studying law involves understanding legal theory and applying this to real life circumstances.
                 There are several different strands such as criminal law, public law and company law
                 as well as legal issues around topics like human rights and the environment.</p>
